# DevOps Toolchain Implementation

This project implements a comprehensive DevOps toolchain using containerized microservices deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The toolchain provides end-to-end CI/CD capabilities, code quality analysis, dependency scanning, and monitoring.

## Architecture Overview

The toolchain consists of the following core microservices:

- CI/CD Pipeline Service (Jenkins/Tekton)
- Code Quality Service (SonarQube)
- Dependency Scanner Service
- Metrics Collection Service (Prometheus/Fluentd)
- Dashboard Service (Grafana)

## Prerequisites

- Google Cloud SDK
- kubectl
- Terraform >= 1.0.0
- Docker
- Helm

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd devops-toolchain
   ```

2. Configure GCP credentials:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

3. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure
   terraform init
   ```

4. Deploy infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

5. Deploy services:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-services.sh
   ```

## Configuration

Each service has its own configuration documented in its respective directory. Core configuration is managed through Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets.

## Security

- All sensitive data is managed through GCP Secret Manager
- RBAC is implemented for service accounts
- Network policies restrict inter-service communication
- Container images are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities

## Monitoring

- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Cloud Monitoring integration
- Automated alerts for critical events
