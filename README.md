
# DevOps Toolchain Project

A comprehensive DevOps infrastructure implementation on Google Cloud Platform with automated CI/CD pipelines, robust monitoring, and infrastructure as code.

## Overview

This project establishes a modern DevOps toolchain using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with integrated CI/CD practices, monitoring solutions, and infrastructure automation. The implementation follows cloud-native principles to enable consistent, reliable, and secure application deployments.

## Features

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete GCP infrastructure defined and managed through Terraform
- **Container Orchestration**: GKE cluster with custom node pools and networking
- **CI/CD Automation**: GitHub Actions pipelines for streamlined build, test, and deployment
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive observability
- **Security Integration**: Built-in security scanning with Trivy and compliance checks
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling capabilities at infrastructure and application levels

## Architecture

The toolchain implements a multi-layer architecture:
