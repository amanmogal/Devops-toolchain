
# DevOps Toolchain Project

A comprehensive DevOps infrastructure implementation on Google Cloud Platform with automated CI/CD pipelines, robust monitoring, and infrastructure as code. This toolchain is designed for real-world deployment across multiple teams and projects.

## Overview

This project establishes a modern DevOps toolchain using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with integrated CI/CD practices, monitoring solutions, and infrastructure automation. The implementation follows cloud-native principles to enable consistent, reliable, and secure application deployments.

## Features

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete GCP infrastructure defined and managed through Terraform
- **Container Orchestration**: GKE cluster with custom node pools and networking
- **CI/CD Automation**: GitHub Actions pipelines for streamlined build, test, and deployment
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive observability
- **Security Integration**: Built-in security scanning with Trivy and compliance checks
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling capabilities at infrastructure and application levels

## Architecture

The toolchain implements a multi-layer architecture:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Platform account with appropriate permissions
- GitHub account
- Terraform installed locally
- Google Cloud SDK installed
- PowerShell (for Windows)

### Deployment Options

#### 1. Single-Team Deployment

```powershell
# Deploy for a single team
.\toolchain.ps1 deploy -Environment dev
```

#### 2. Multi-Team Deployment

```powershell
# Deploy with multi-team support
.\toolchain.ps1 deploy -Environment dev -MultiTeam

# Register a project for a specific team
.\toolchain.ps1 register -ProjectName "my-project" -RepositoryUrl "https://github.com/org/repo" -TeamName "team-a"
```

#### 3. Dedicated Instances per Team

```powershell
# Create a dedicated instance for a team
.\toolchain.ps1 create-instance -ConfigFile "configs/projects/my-project/config.json"
```
