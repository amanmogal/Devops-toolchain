# DevOps Toolchain User Guide

This guide is designed for development teams using the DevOps toolchain.

## Introduction

The DevOps toolchain provides an integrated set of tools for continuous integration, continuous deployment, code quality analysis, and monitoring. This guide will help you understand how to effectively use these tools in your daily development workflow.

## Components

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)

Jenkins automates your build, test, and deployment processes.

#### Key Features:
- Automated builds on code commits
- Parallel test execution
- Deployment to multiple environments
- Integration with code quality tools

#### How to Use:
- View build status: Access the Jenkins dashboard at http://jenkins-ip:8080
- Configure builds: Edit your Jenkinsfile in your repository
- View build logs: Click on a specific build and select "Console Output"

### 2. Code Quality Analysis (SonarQube)

SonarQube provides static code analysis to identify code smells, bugs, and security vulnerabilities.

#### Key Features:
- Code quality metrics
- Security vulnerability detection
- Test coverage visualization
- Quality gates

#### How to Use:
- View project quality: Access SonarQube at http://sonarqube-ip:9000
- Configure analysis: Add a sonar-project.properties file to your repository
- Quality gates: Define minimum quality criteria for deployments

### 3. Monitoring and Observability (Prometheus + Grafana)

Comprehensive monitoring of your applications and infrastructure.

#### Key Features:
- Real-time metrics collection
- Customizable dashboards
- Alerting capabilities
- Performance insights

#### How to Use:
- View dashboards: Access Grafana at http://grafana-ip:80
- Application metrics: Add Prometheus client libraries to your applications
- Create alerts: Configure alert rules in Grafana

### 4. Dependency Scanner

Identifies vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

#### Key Features:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- License compliance checks
- Remediation recommendations

#### How to Use:
- View vulnerability reports: Check CI/CD pipeline results
- Fix vulnerabilities: Update dependencies based on recommendations

## Workflow Examples

### Getting Started with a New Project

1. **Register your project**:
   ```powershell
   .\toolchain.ps1 register -ProjectName "my-project" -RepositoryUrl "https://github.com/org/my-project" -TeamName "my-team"
   ```

2. **Set up your repository**:
   - Add CI/CD configuration
   - Configure SonarQube properties
   - Create Kubernetes manifests

3. **First deployment**:
   - Push code to your repository
   - Monitor the CI/CD pipeline
   - View deployment status

### Daily Development Workflow

1. **Code development**:
   - Clone your repository
   - Create a feature branch
   - Implement changes
   - Run local tests

2. **Code review process**:
   - Create a pull request
   - CI/CD pipeline runs automatically
   - Review SonarQube code quality results
   - Address feedback

3. **Deployment**:
   - Merge pull request to main branch
   - CI/CD pipeline deploys to development
   - Verify deployment in development environment
   - Promote to production when ready

### Monitoring Your Application

1. **View application health**:
   - Access Grafana dashboards
   - Check key performance metrics
   - Monitor error rates and response times

2. **Troubleshooting**:
   - View detailed logs
   - Analyze performance bottlenecks
   - Set up custom alerts

## Best Practices

1. **Code Quality**:
   - Write automated tests with good coverage
   - Address SonarQube issues promptly
   - Use consistent code formatting

2. **CI/CD**:
   - Keep build times short
   - Ensure pipelines are idempotent
   - Use feature flags for risky changes

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Define meaningful SLIs and SLOs
   - Set up alerts for critical metrics
   - Use structured logging
